This is the codebase used to make all of the figures in Rempe, Michael J et al. “Mathematical modeling of sleep state dynamics in a rodent model of shift work.” Neurobiology of sleep and circadian rhythms vol. 5 37-51. 28 Apr. 2018, doi:10.1016/j.nbscr.2018.04.002


# Usage
Save all of the .m files in the same directory.  The main script is called script_to_plot_AW_and_RW_simulations.m.  Run this in Matlab (while having the .mat files with the experimental data in the same folder). 
This will generate all of the figures, tables and stats shown in the manuscript.
